# liri-node-app

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. Using this application you are able to take on data from the bands in town, spotify, and omdb apis and display them in your terminal.

You will need the following npm packages installed to run this program, Node-Spotify-API, Axios : This module will be used to get the IMDB and BandsInTown API data, Moment and, DotEnv

By typing node liri.js and either "spotify-this-song", "concert-this", or "movie-this" it will call on the api and return the data you asked for.

Spotify-this-song in action.
